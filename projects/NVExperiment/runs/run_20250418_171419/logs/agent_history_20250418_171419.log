[2025-04-18 17:14:44] ASSISTANT: <think>
To characterize NVs, we should follow a systematic approach:
1. First, we need to do a GalvoScan to locate potential NVs
2. After identifying bright spots, we can use FindNV for more precise localization
3. Finally, we'll need ESR measurements for each NV found
4. Optimization might be needed between steps

Let's start with GalvoScan using default configuration, then analyze the results before proceeding to the next steps.

Now that I have user permission, I will:
1. Run the GalvoScan script with default configuration
2. After it completes, we'll need to analyze the resulting plot to identify NV locations
3. Based on those results, we'll plan the next steps (FindNV for precise locations)
