[2025-04-19 11:28:10] USER: characterize NVs for me
[2025-04-19 11:28:17] ASSISTANT: <think>
To characterize NVs, we should follow a systematic approach:
1. First, we need to do a coarse scan using GalvoScan to identify potential NV locations
2. Then we can use FindNV for more precise localization
3. Finally, we can perform ESR measurements and optimization
Let's start with the GalvoScan using default configuration.

Now that I have user permission, I will:
1. Run the galvo scan script with the default configuration
2. After it completes, I'll analyze the scan results using vision
3. Based on those results, we'll move to more precise characterization
Let's execute the galvo scan first and wait for results before proceeding further.
