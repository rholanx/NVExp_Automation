[2025-04-03 16:34:28] USER: characterize the NV sample that I just loaded in
[2025-04-03 16:34:33] ASSISTANT: <think>
To characterize a new NV sample, we should follow a systematic approach:
1. First, we need to do a galvo scan to find NVs in the field of view
2. Later we can do more detailed characterization of specific NVs
3. Let's start by reading the default galvo scan config and then run a scan
