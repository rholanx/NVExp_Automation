To run the find_nv experiment, I should:
1. First read the default configuration
2. Ask to write a new config file with default settings
3. Ask permission to run the find_nv script
4. After running, I should analyze the results using vision
Let me start with reading the default config.

[2025-04-03 16:35:25] USER: let's just read a plot and find the bright spots
[2025-04-03 16:35:30] ASSISTANT: <think>
Since we want to analyze existing NV data, I should:
1. Use the vision command to look at the GalvoScan plot first, as this would show the coarse locations of NVs
2. Analyze any bright spots in the image to identify potential NV centers
3. Report these coordinates to the user

I will use the vision command to analyze the GalvoScan plot. After receiving the results, I will interpret any bright spots and their coordinates before suggesting next steps.

[2025-04-03 16:35:44] ACTION: [System] Vision analysis result:
The image shows a confocal microscopy scan or plot with two distinct bright spots visible against a darker background. The image has:

- A title labeled "Confocal Image"
- X-axis range from approximately -5.0 to -3.0
- Y-axis range from -1.0 to 1.0
- A color scale on the right indicating intensity in "kcounts/sec" ranging from 0 to 9

The two bright spots appear to be at approximately:
1. One at around position (-3.8, -0.5)
2. Another at around position (-3.6, 0.7)

These bright spots show higher intensity (yellowish) compared to the surrounding reddish-brown background, indicating areas of higher photon counts or signal. This type of confocal image is commonly used in scientific applications like microscopy, where the bright spots might represent fluorescent markers, quantum dots, or other structures of interest.

The pixelated appearance suggests this is raw data from a scanning confocal microscope, where each pixel corresponds to a measurement at a specific position.
